# Randomized API

## What is this?

Well, I think the name already indicates, but it is an API with specific routes that bring random returns based on the theme that that route provides, such as random projects to do, random numbers, and a hell much more things

## But, why?

Ok, I have to admit, there's not much need, but I guarantee you've also wanted to program something, but had no idea what to do to put it in the portfolio, so it's not a bad idea to take any crazy project from here and just do it. At least you will learn and will have a great time making them.
